 - Boundary conditions: Fixed mean velocity at the cylinder inlet, 1 m/s; for more details on boundary conditions, refer to slide 13 of 'OpenFOAM Vortex Shedding Case Description' file
 - Data analysis: Centered parameter study

 - Input parameter: Reynold's number (by varying the kinematic viscosity) -- between 0 and 200. 
 - Output parameter: Drag coefficient -- final timestep
 - The results from this study were in good agreement (max. discrepancy - 5%) with literature data [2 - 13].
